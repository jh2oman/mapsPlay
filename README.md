# MapsPlay
MapsPlay is a game in which the user finds themselves in a random Google Street View instance around the world and must guess their location. I am especially proud of the Javascript in this application, which uses a Singleton based design pattern to make clean modular code. The application took me roughly 4 months to complete in my spare time, and is completely responsive on mobile browsers.
